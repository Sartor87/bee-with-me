#   ./scripts/backup.sh [--container ID] [OUT_DIR] [KEEP]
#
# --container ID dumps that container instead of the one found by its compose labels (project
# bee-with-me, service db); the start scripts use it to back up an older install (project "docker").
#
# OUT_DIR should be a USB stick or a second drive — a backup on the same disk as the
# database is not a backup. Defaults to ./backups, KEEP defaults to 30.
#
# Works with Podman (default) or Docker; set CONTAINER_ENGINE to force one. Dumps are pg_dump custom format (.dump); restore with scripts/restore.sh, which runs pg_restore (hint printed at the end).
