# Application architecture: Bee With Me

**Version:** 0.1 (Phase C)
**Status:** Draft
**Last updated:** 2026-10-03
**Describes:** version 1.7.1 on branch `feature/effis-fire-layers`; *target* marks components from the EFFIS
plan that are not written yet

Mutable supporting document. The stable summary is in
[Architecture.md, Section 4](../Architecture.md#4-phase-c-information-systems-architectures). Interfaces are in
[api-contracts.md](api-contracts.md).

## 1. Style

A **modular monolith on one machine** ([ADR 6](../decisions/0006-modular-monolith-in-process-tasks.md)): one
FastAPI process holds the REST API, the WebSocket endpoint and every background task (hardware readers,
notification listener, cleanup, and in the target the fire poller and fire alarm service). The database is
the integration point: writers insert and call `pg_notify`; one listener forwards notifications to browsers
([ADR 7](../decisions/0007-pg-notify-websocket-live-channel.md)). The browser runs a Vue single-page app
([ADR 9](../decisions/0009-vue-spa-openlayers.md)).

## 2. Containers (C4 level 2)

    Rel(spa, tiles, "Tiles, weather when online", "HTTPS")
    Rel(spa, tileserver, "Tiles")
    Rel(scripts, db, "pg_dump, pg_restore, migrate guard")
```

In development the map client is served by the Vite dev server on :5173 and the backend by uvicorn on
:8000 (R-11). Container layout and ports belong to Phase D.

## 4. Key flows

### 4.1 Position frame to every screen

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as RescuerBee
    participant G as Gateway (USB HID)
    participant R as HID reader
    participant P as Parser
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant W as WSManager
    participant B as Browsers

    D->>G: LoRa frame
    G->>R: 64-byte packets
    R->>P: assembled frame text
    P-->>R: BeeFrame (dev_sn, MGRS, flags, CRC ok)
    R->>G: ACK
    R->>DB: look up device and person
    R->>DB: INSERT location_events (received_at = now)
    R->>DB: pg_notify('location_update', payload)
    DB-->>W: NOTIFY
    W->>B: {"type": "location_update", ...}
    Note over R,G: R-06: the frame can be marked seen and ACKed before the INSERT commits
```

> ⚠️ **Requires technical clarification:** the exact order of ACK, dedupe and INSERT in `hid_reader` must be
> checked against real hardware (R-06, R-07). This diagram shows the intended order.

### 4.2 SOS raised and resolved

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Reader
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant W as WSManager
    participant B as Browser (any user)
    participant API as Backend REST

    R->>DB: INSERT location_events (sos_active)
    R->>DB: open SOS exists? no → INSERT sos_alerts
    R->>DB: pg_notify('sos_alert', {id, device, name, rank})
    DB-->>W: NOTIFY
    W->>B: {"type": "sos_alert", ...}
    B->>B: banner, toast, sound until resolved
    Note over B: radio response, outside the system (ADR 3)
    B->>API: POST /api/locations/sos/{id}/resolve?notes=...
    API->>DB: UPDATE sos_alerts SET resolved_at, resolved_by
    Note over B,API: Page reload: GET /api/locations/sos restores open alerts (BP-02)
```

### 4.3 Fire data and fire alarm (target)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Fire poller (30 min)
    participant E as EFFIS/GWIS
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant A as FireAlarmService (60 s)
    participant W as WSManager
    participant B as Browsers

    P->>E: WFS GetFeature (bounding box only)
    E-->>P: GeoJSON (bounded size, timeout)
    P->>DB: upsert hotspots, burnt areas; prune
    P->>DB: pg_notify('fire_data_updated')
    P-->>A: request evaluation
    A->>DB: load settings, rescuer positions, hotspots, zones, open alerts
    A->>A: haversine distances (pure)
    A->>DB: INSERT fire_alerts; pg_notify('fire_alert')
    DB-->>W: NOTIFY
    W->>B: fire_alert, then fire_alert_repeat until acknowledged
    B->>DB: POST /api/fire/alerts/{id}/acknowledge (via REST)
```

## 5. Authentication and authorisation

| Aspect | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Identity | Local accounts in `users` ([ADR 8](../decisions/0008-local-accounts-jwt.md)) | Unchanged |
| Tokens | JWT HS256: access 60 min, refresh 7 days; stored by the SPA | Unchanged |
| Roles | `admin` for all writes; reads need only a login | Admin-only deletes (BR-07) |
| `/ws` | **No authentication** (R-02) | Token on connect before multi-user use |
| `/uploads` | **No authentication** (R-09) | Served through an authenticated endpoint |
| CORS | `*` (R-03) | Local origins only |
| First login | Default `admin`/`admin` on an empty database (R-08) | Forced password change |
| `rescuer` vs `viewer` | No difference in the API today | ⚠️ owner: are these roles used? |

> ⚠️ **Requires stakeholder input (owner):** do `rescuer` and `viewer` accounts exist in practice, and should a
> `viewer` (for example a partner on the wall display) see blood types, phones and PINs? Today every logged-in
> user can read them (R-23).

---

## 6. Open technical questions

**Two gateway paths stay.** The owner confirmed (2026-10-03) that the serial reader stays alongside the USB
HID reader. Both share the frame processing in `hardware_reader/reader.py`.

> ⚠️ **Requires technical clarification:** both readers start at every boot. Decide whether one installation
> uses one gateway at a time (then start only the configured reader) or both at once (then a frame seen by
> both must be stored once). Validate with real hardware (R-24).

**Future integrations.** The owner confirmed (2026-10-03) that more integrations will come, **wind data first**
(wind-shift warnings, draft spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-wind-shift-alerts-design.md`), then
possibly APRS and Meshtastic. Each new source follows the fire-data pattern so it cannot hurt core tracking
(TP-02):

| Integration | Kind | Pattern to follow |
|-------------|------|-------------------|
| Wind data (OpenWeatherMap today, keyless Open-Meteo considered) | Online feed | Backend poller with timeout and size limit, stored with its age, `pg_notify` on change, last known value shown when the link drops; no API key in the browser (R-05) |
| APRS | Second position source (radio) | A new reader feeding the same frame processing and the same tables; device identity mapping decided in an ADR |
| Meshtastic | Second position and message source (LoRa mesh) | As APRS; may need a new device type |

> ⚠️ **Requires stakeholder input (owner):** order and scope of APRS and Meshtastic, and whether they need
> to send to devices (today the system only receives).
